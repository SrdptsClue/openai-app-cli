Working through MCP gives you several benefits out of the box:

Discovery integration – the model consumes your tool metadata and surface descriptions the same way it does for first-party connectors, enabling natural-language discovery and launcher ranking. See Discovery for details.
Conversation awareness – structured content and component state flow through the conversation. The model can inspect the JSON result, refer to IDs in follow-up turns, or render the component again later.
Multiclient support – MCP is self-describing, so your connector works across ChatGPT web and mobile without custom client code.
Extensible auth – the specification includes protected resource metadata, OAuth 2.1 flows, and dynamic client registration so you can control access without inventing a proprietary handshake.
