The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open specification for connecting large language model clients to external tools and resources. An MCP server exposes tools that a model can call during a conversation, and return results given specified parameters. Other resources (metadata) can be returned along with tool results, including the inline html that we can use in the Apps SDK to render an interface.

With Apps SDK, MCP is the backbone that keeps server, model, and UI in sync. By standardising the wire format, authentication, and metadata, it lets ChatGPT reason about your app the same way it reasons about built-in tools.
