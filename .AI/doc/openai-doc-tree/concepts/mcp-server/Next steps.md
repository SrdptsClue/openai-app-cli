If youâ€™re new to MCP, we recommend starting with the following resources:

Model Context Protocol specification
Official SDKs: Python SDK (official; includes FastMCP module) and TypeScript
MCP Inspector for local debugging
Once you are comfortable with the MCP primitives, you can move on to the Set up your server guide for implementation details.
